        <img class="pokemon" src="https://i.imgur.com/GVRQFYB.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        &quot;Greninja is the final evolution of Pokémon X and Y water-type
        starter Froakie. It has the ability to take on an appearance
        resembling its trainer. Pokedex says: Greninja creates throwing stars
        out of compressed water. When it spins them and throws them at high
        speed, these stars can split metal in two.&quot;

      </div>
      <p>
        &quot;Lucario is a bipedal, wolf-like Pokémon with blue, cream, and
        black fur. It is considered to be prideful and loyal to its trainer.
        Pokedex says: By catching the aura emanating from others, Lucario can
        read their thoughts and movements.&quot;

      </div>
      <p>
        &quot;Mimikyu caused quite a stir for its peculiar looks and sad
        backstory when it was originally announced for Pokémon Sun and Moon in
        2016. Mimikyu is described as a Pokémon who felt so lonely that it
        decided to wear a rag in order to look like Pikachu, everyone’s
        favorite Pokémon. Pokedex says: Its actual appearance is unknown. A
        scholar who saw what was under its rag was overwhelmed by terror and
        died from the shock.&quot;

      <img class="character p4" src="https://i.imgur.com/44t6MZH.jpg?2" alt="" />

      </div>
      <p>
        &quot;Charizard is an orange draconic Pokémon who has a fiery temper.
        It is the final evolution of Charmander, one of the starter Pokémon
        for the original game. Pokedex says: Charizard flies around the sky in
        search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that
        it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any
        opponent weaker than itself. &quot;

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="96" data-line-end="97">Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="98" data-line-end="99">1.What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="100" data-line-end="101">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="100" data-line-end="101">We’re sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent’s evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you’ve bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="101" data-line-end="105">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="101" data-line-end="102">Answer is Raichu</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="103" data-line-end="104">2.What’s the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="105" data-line-end="106">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="105" data-line-end="106">Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There’s the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you’re looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you’ve made your way through any Pokemon game, you’ve reached the point where you’re presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.</p>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="106" data-line-end="108">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="106" data-line-end="107">Answer is Master Ball</p>
